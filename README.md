# BTT-Manta-Mounts

These are two mounts that I designed for the BigTreeTech Manta M8P to fit on a Din Rail using a SSR Mount with 4 screws.  I accept no responsibility for how you use these mounts or if they will work for you.  Thank you and have fun.

If you have any questions or problems please let know.

I will try to keep these updated if anything changes.
